            The Eurofighter Typhoon is the world's most modern swing-role fighter. It can carry up to six bombs and six missiles, a cannon and a targeting pod, with sufficient processing power to simultaneously support missile in-flight updates and bomb in-flight targeting. Combining a proven, agile airframe built from stealth materials with the latest sensor, control and weapons systems delivers optimum combat capability – both beyond visual range (BVR) and in close combat.
        <br><br>
            Eurofighter Typhoon is built on a consortium of 4 European nations: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain, and their leading aerospace and defence companies. While Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH coordinates the programme on Industry side, the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) acts as the single point of contact for customers and governments. Each partner company assembles its own national air force, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports).

                The Eurojet EJ200 is a military low bypass turbofan used as the powerplant of the Eurofighter Typhoon. The engine is largely based on the Rolls-Royce XG-40 technology demonstrator which was developed in the 1980s. The EJ200 is built by the EuroJet Turbo GmbH consortium. The engines deliver 1,000 flying hours without needing unscheduled maintenance.

           Leonardo company leads the Euroradar consortium responsible for developing the Typhoon’s primary sensor, the Captor-E radar. It gives the pilot an enhanced wide field of regard which offers significant benefits for both Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface engagements.

              The Pirate Sensor is the first in the world design derived from the weapon system specification and an ideal supplement to Radar and the DASS (Defensive Aid Sub System). Developed by the Leonardo-led Eurofirst international consortium, the Pirate Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST) allows the Typhoon aircrew to simultaneously detect and track single or multiple targets across a wide field of regard against the most heavily congested operational environment.

             Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of UK weapons, and has been since the 1960s. The UK government is intimately involved in these deals as they are operated through Government-to-Government contracts. These contracts are complemented by those between the UK government and the prime contractors. The Al Yamamah (dove) agreements of the mid-1980s were between the Thatcher government in the UK and the Saudi Arabian government. Military equipment, especially Tornado and Hawk jets, were to be supplied by what is now BAE Systems. The deals also included servicing, spares and ancillary services. Al Yamamah was originally designed as a barter agreement with Saudi Arabia paying in oil. However, an oil price crash in the mid-1980s meant that the UK government had to use its Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), now UK Export Finance, to underwrite the deal for £1 billion. The Bank of England and the Treasury had doubts about these arrangements. In 2007, BAE sold 72 of its Eurofighter Typhoons to Saudi Arabia in a £4.4 billion deal called The Salam Project.  Outstanding price issues were finally agreed in February 2014 after a visit from Prince Charles. The Typhoons replace the Air Defence Variant Tornados supplied under the Al Yamamah deals; the remaining Tornados continue to be upgraded and serviced under what is now called Saudi British Defence Co-operation Programme.
