             The Dutch parliament has voted to ban arms exports to Saudi Arabia in protest against the kingdom’s humanitarian and rights violations. It sees the Netherlands become the first EU country to put in practice a motion by the European Parliament in February 2016 urging a bloc-wide Saudi arms embargo. The bill quoted UN figures which suggest almost 6,000 people - half of them civilians - have been killed since Saudi-led troops entered the conflict in Yemen. According to Reuters, the Dutch bill asks the government to implement a strict weapons embargo that includes dual-use exports which could potentially be used to violate human rights.<br>

        <p class="font"><span style="margin-left:4em">In July 2019 the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaag decided, on the basis of new information, to remove previously imposed restrictions on Egypt. For the other countries in question (Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) the restrictions will remain in place. Since 27 November 2018 a presumption of denial was instituted on arms exports to the UAE and Egypt. This presumption of denial had previously been introduced for Saudi Arabia. The more restrictive policy was prompted by a report by the Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen which posited a link between the navies of the coalition countries and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.</span><br> 
                 
             <span style="margin-left:4em"> In this context, ‘presumption of denial’ means that an export licence for military goods will not be issued for these end users unless it has been incontrovertibly demonstrated that the goods will not be used in the conflict in Yemen. In contrast with normal policy on assessing the risk of arms exports, the burden of proof under the new policy is thus reversed. The government is closely monitoring the situation in Yemen. New information about the involvement of the Egyptian navy in the operation in Yemen suggests that the navy is being deployed mainly to secure the waterways around the Suez Canal. There is no reason to assume that Egypt is involved in the maritime blockade of Yemen. This is why the presumption-of-denial policy was lifted for Egypt.

    <p class="font">In August 2015, Saudi Arabia sent new military equipment into Yemen, including dozens of tanks, armored vehicles and personnel carriers. In 2012 the Dutch government has granted an export license for communication systems for Saudi Main Battle Tanks worth € 6.6 million. In 2012 Thales said it was expecting follow-up orders for several hundreds of vehicles. The stage of this follow-up order is unknown. The Netherlands sold components for Typhoon and F-15 Fighter jets: both aircrafts are used in air strikes on Yemen.<br>

    <p class="font">The UAE used the M109 Howitzer in Yemen. Propelled grenades fired by these howitzers have a range of 35 kilometers and can be used for heavy shelling at long distance. A tactic with an enormous risk of collateral damage. The Netherlands sold 87 of these heavy self-propelled artillery systems (M109A2/A3 version or M109L47) to the UAE in 1997, after an RDM upgrade. There are still 858 or 879 in use. (Jordan also bought M109 howitzers from the Netherlands, but is not involved in ground operations in Yemen.) The sale of the howitzers to the UAE itself may be a long time ago; however, according to the last published reports the Netherlands exported components for M109 howitzers as
recent as 2014. Also, in April 2006 and in December 2011, 52200 grenades of this calibre from Germany
left Flushing (Vlissingen) by a ship heading for the UAE. <br>
